# TalkToRepo

TalkToRepo is an application designed to help users interact with GitHub repositories using natural language queries. It leverages the power of generative AI and vector search to provide detailed and accurate responses about the contents of a repository.

## Features

- **Interactive Querying**: Ask questions about the code and get detailed answers.
- **Automated Vector Store Creation**: Automatically processes the repository files and creates a vector store for efficient querying.
- **Conversational AI**: Maintains chat history to improve the context of responses.
- **Supports Multiple File Types**: Works with Python (`.py`), Jupyter notebooks (`.ipynb`), and Markdown (`.md`) files.

## Installation

1. **Clone the Repository**:
    ```bash
    git clone <your-repo-link>
    cd <your-repo-directory>
    ```

2. **Set Up the Environment**:
    - Install the required dependencies:
      ```bash
      pip install -r requirements.txt
      ```
    - Create a `.env` file in the root directory with the following content:
      ```
      # Example .env file
      HUGGINGFACE_API_KEY=your_huggingface_api_key
      ```

3. **Run the Application**:
    ```bash
    streamlit run app.py
    ```

## Usage

1. **Open the Application**:
    - Navigate to the URL provided by Streamlit after running the application.

2. **Enter the Repository Link**:
    - Input the GitHub repository link in the sidebar and click "Submit".
    - Wait for the engine to build and prepare the vector store.

3. **Ask Questions**:
    - Enter your questions about the repository in the chat input field.
    - View the detailed responses generated by the AI model.

## Project Structure

- **`utils.py`**: Contains the core logic for processing the repository, creating the vector store, and generating responses using the AI model.
- **`app.py`**: Streamlit application file that defines the user interface and handles user interactions.
- **`requirements.txt`**: List of required Python packages.
- **`.env`**: Environment file to store API keys and other configuration settings.

## Dependencies
